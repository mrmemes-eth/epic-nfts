# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

## Useful Docker commands:

```shell
# Build the container:
docker build . -t epicnfts/latest
# get a bash shell in the container and forward ports:
docker-compose run --rm --service-ports epicnfts
```
